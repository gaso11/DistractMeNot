        The purpose of this app is to help users avoid distractions on their phone. Many of us
        have distractions such as notifications, Social Media Platforms, messages and many other
        things. This app hopes to address those issues by preventing the user for accessing apps
        and notifications.\n\n

        Set up:\n\n

        1) On the setup page, tap create at the bottom of the screen.\n\n
        2) Enter in the requested information and tap create and apply.\n\n
        3) That is it! Your settings will be applied to your phone.\n\n

        Verify that your setting is active on the Mode screen and you are good to go!
